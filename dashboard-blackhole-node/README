What the script does is ask DashBoard about ALL failed jobs in the last X hours, and compile a distribution of the job failures. 
If any node has considerably more failures (default threshold = 10%, configurable in the script) it will be reported as bad and might be worth to investigate.

So 2 parameters to think about changing is OffSet hours and failure rate threshold.

Currently to keep it simple there is no "midnight treatment". You definitely want that "date" - "offset" >= midnight.

This is supposed to be as simple as an HTTP query to CMS DashBoard and JSON parsing to produce the results in the example.

Make sure to edit the script and set your site name. Tiradani's patch introduces some improvements here. To be commited soon.

After configuring your site name run :

[samir@localhost dashboard-blackhole-node]$ ./error-report.py 

compute-22-32.tier2 had 2 failures
compute-31-3.tier2 had 6 failures
compute-22-13.tier2 had 2 failures
compute-22-35.tier2 had 128 failures
=================================
average failure rate is 34
Total failures: 138
=================================
node compute-22-35.tier2 is bad with 0.927536 failures
